# MARKDOWN INSTRUCTIVE MODELS

## WELCOME! ðŸ‘‹
To, task specific engineered instrutives for ChatGPT and other LLM's. I'll use this space for posting Ai related prompt Instructives, and templates of my creation.

## MOTIVES
I have only two motives for doing this:
1. Exploring and experimenting ChatGPT capabilities in creative endevours like writing novels, essays, scripts, plays, etc. You get the idea.
2. Because its fun!, and I feel like sharing.


## CONTEXT
In my exciment experimentation with ChatGPT on my creative endevours. I often found myself reading, watching, and testing too many prompts that could fullfil my needs; sadly with little or no concrete results. I find these alledgly _"Prompt Engineers"_ lacking of something fundamental an _'Oomph'_ or _'je ne sais quoi'_. I find GPT and LLM models in general flexible, well crafted smart tools and as any tool, used or guided in certain way makes the difference, exponencially communicating or doing unexpected things. Lots of prompts out there are overly-hyped, too simplistic, not even archieving more than two paragraph of text, these prompts are just that prompts. There is no indication, none that im aware of, that could guide GPT to write or do certain tasks. 

As a graphic designer, _communicating is fundamental_, the process on doing so is essential. ChatGPT asseses that very well in my opinion.
Through several research, iterations and testing, I have composed a prompt engineering approach, I call for now ***"Instructive Model"***.


## MARKDOWN INSTRUCTIVE MODEL:
The ***"Instructive model"***, is my input approach of prompt enginieering for _Large Language Models (LLM's)_ like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), [OpenAi Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground) or any other llm model.
These are written in Markdown files, crafted to Role play a certain character wtih well-tuned guides on how to perform by only completing a certain task using [Tree of thought Framework](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/tree-of-thought-llm) in several aspects of user interaction, outputs, and overall experience.


## TEST
In this repository you find two things
1. [NOVEL-GPT - Storywriter model v1]() - this is a tested model, i build up for you to test. You can use it as if, or change watherver paramenter you like.
2. [A Template]() - Mold it to suit your specific needs, oho! It's a thing fo beauty, innit?
