Whispers speak of an individual capable of extraordinary feats resembling magic never witnessed before—a man named Roy.

To her surprise, Roy is neither a warrior, dark lord, hero, nor powerful wizard, but an unassuming and lazy "Artist," possessing a myriad of skills in arts, design, marketing, technology, and creativity.
